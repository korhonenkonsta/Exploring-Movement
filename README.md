# Exploring-Movement
The idea of the game is to focus everything around movement abilities of the player. The game starts with very basic, limited set of movement options, but expands greatly as the player explores the world and can reach new areas as new movement options are unlocked. With skilful control, it's possible to reach areas without finding all the available movement enhancements. The game engine is Unity and scripting is done in C#. Credit for the character controller template goes to Erik Roystan Ross.
